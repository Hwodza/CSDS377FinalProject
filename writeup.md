One thing I learned is how to use Django to create html templates and later extend them, manage db models, and use the built-in admin panel. The way Django implements concepts like template inheritance, URL routing, and ORM makes complex web development tasks more manageable. One thing I found surprising is how extensive the Django's authentication system is out of the box. The `LoginRequiredMixin`, for example, was surprisingly easy to set up compared to other frameworks' guards.
