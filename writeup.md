# Assignment 7

## Coneway and Odza

This assignment was extra challenging for me. In the initial setup, I encountered countless errors. I learned to double-check my spelling, confirm that symlinks are up and functioning, and understand the importance of directories' structure. Furthermore, the term "edge" is new to me, so I did some reading on my own to better understand it. I will be curious to see how this is important when we begin wrapping other applications around our system. The most surprising part of this assignment was how often I ran into file permission errors breaking things in the code.

## Henry Odza

This week was definitely the most challenging assignment to date. The most valuable thing that I learned this week was definitely how to properly test through the edges and seams. One thing that suprised me was how truly awful some of the error messages I got were. I remember I had an issue where I forgot to do json.dumps for the paho publish single command in lampi/models.py and the error messages I got didn't even mention models.py, so it took forever to figure out that was the problem.
