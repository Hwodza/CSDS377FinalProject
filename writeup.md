I had never used DevOps tools before, so using ansible was a new and unique experience. Additionally, learning how the bindings work was interesting and took a little bit to get used too. Also, I am forcing myself to use vim for this and I have noticed an increase in my vim ability. One thing that suprised me was the effect different operating systems have on development. I used an old laptop running linux mint and while ansible was a little frustrating, it took me significantly less time compared to the people I know who did it on windows.

Throughout this assignment I learned a lot more commands that made programming in nano much more efficient. I also gained a much deeper understanding of how the kivy layouts work and how versatile they are to create an interactive UI. One thing I found surprising was how impactful the distinctions between operating systems were on the software installation process. Since I am on a windows laptop, it was a very tedious process getting the ansible software installed and making the appropriate configurations for the pi.
