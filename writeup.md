# Assignment 5

## Odza and Rojanasakdakul

## Henry Odza

In this assignment I learned how to create a webapp that can connect to an mqtt broker and remote device. One thing that suprised me was how simple looking some of the javascript ended up looking, it took a while to get to that point since I don't find js intuitative but it was still interesting.

## Sam Rojanasakdakul

In this assignment I learned how to create a static webapp. I haven't use javascript as much but I learned how to utilize css, html, and js to create a webapp. The challenging part was connecting connecting all the devices together through the EC2.
